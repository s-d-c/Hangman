# Hangman
=========

A simple interactive hangman game that selects a random word from an API, displays the blank letters, and asks the user to input letter guesses.  If the user gets 6 wrong guesses the hanging man is fully revealed and it's a loss. If the user guesses all the letters in the word, they win.

This was the first project from the Web Development Immersive program I took at General Assembly.
